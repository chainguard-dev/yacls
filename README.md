Collect user ACLs from SaaS platforms and export them to YAML files optimized for readability.

![yacls](images/logo-small.png?raw=true "yacls logo")

yacls is designed to make regular access control audits easy by
offering a familiar standardized format (YAML) for easy reviews and diffing.

The output is optimized for being reviewed by humans within a Github PR periodically
and is carefully tuned to make policy drift easy to notice.

## FAQ

### Why not use the APIs provided by each vendor?

The current structure was put in place because of a separation of duties, where the person running the tool was not the one who had admin access to each SaaS platform. It doesn't help that many SaaS platforms do not provide a documented API to retrieve user lists (Vercel, I'm looking at you!)

At the moment, the only fully automated audit is GCP, though we would like to add more direct API support. HELP WANTED!
